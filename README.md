# EF2 (Enhanced Forge 2)
Forge enhancements to the new version of ElDewrito (0.6)

ElDewrito is a community-made mod for Halo Online, a cancelled free Halo 3 derived PC game for the Russian market. It allows the game to be played in player-hosted servers and aims to restore removed features, fix bugs and glitches, and add mod support.

This adds around 230 objects into the Forge Gametype. These objects are in the games memory but previously unusable as they weren't added to the forge menu upon release of 0.6. Allows you to use them in creating maps and distrubiting them. Even to people who don't have this mod, due to these items actually already existing in the game.
