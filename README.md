# EF2 (Enhanced Forge 2)
Forge enhancements to the new version of ElDewrito (0.6)

ElDewrito is a community-made mod for Halo Online, a cancelled free Halo 3 derived PC game for the Russian market. It allows the game to be played in player-hosted servers and aims to restore removed features, fix bugs and glitches, and add mod support.

This adds around 230 objects into the Forge Gametype. These objects are in the games memory but previously unusable as they weren't added to the forge menu upon release of 0.6. Allows you to use them in creating maps and distrubiting them. Even to people who don't have this mod, due to these items actually already existing in the game. 

# Enhanced Forge Mod
Enhanced Forge for Eldewrito 0.5.1

ElDewrito is a community-made mod for Halo Online, a cancelled free Halo 3 derived PC game for the Russian market. It allows the game to be played in player-hosted servers and aims to restore removed features, fix bugs and glitches, and add mod support.

## Description

Due to the way the game works there was hundreads of objects loaded in the games memory but where previously unplaceable.
After poking around in the games files I found out that you could add these objects by making some changes. 
I decided to fix this as it enabled better map making. Most maps before this mod where very basic in nature due to item limits and being unable to phase objects.
This allowed the Custom game/Forge to community thrive.
Due to the items already being in the games files you could share maps made with this mod with users who didn't and it would still work.

Most of these additions went on to make it in Eldewrito's biggest update, the 0.6 update.

# Features

This adds hundreds of objects across every map, aswell as implementing some quality of life changes. Such as pre phasing some objects to
make them more usuable when making maps. Adding more teleporter channels to open up more options (previously capped at 10, now 255).
Increases the count of each object to 255 compared previously which was alot lower, which limited creativity.
These objects are in the games memory but previously unusable as they weren't added to the forge menu upon release of 0.6. 
Allows you to use them in creating maps and distrubiting them. 
Even to people who don't have this mod, due to these items actually already existing in the game.
